* Rename ESRI-Shapefiles®

The tool ~shpmv~ is a Perl script to rename an ensemble of ESRI-Shapefiles®. 

The original set of files for a spatial layer comes often
with so called sidecar files produced by third party application. The
tool keeps track of this files during the rename process and renames them too.

The current [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile][list of extensions]] in alphabethical order is:

- ~ain~ and ~aih~ -- an attribute index of the active fields in a table
  ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~atx~ -- an attribute index for the .dbf file in the form of
  shapefile.columnname.atx (ArcGIS 8 and later) 
  ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~cpg~ -- used to specify the code page (only for .dbf) for
  identifying the character encoding to be used
  ~{content-type: text/plain OR x-gis/x-shapefile }

- ~dbf~ ^* -- attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in
   dBase IV format ~{content-type: application/octet-stream OR  text/plain}~

- ~fbn~ and ~fbx~ --  a spatial index of the features that are read-only
             ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~ixs~ --  a geocoding index for read-write datasets
             ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~mxs~ -- a geocoding index for read-write datasets (ODB format)
  ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~prj~ -- projection description, using a well-known text
  representation of coordinate reference systems ~{content-type:
  text/plain OR application/text}~

- ~sbn~ and ~sbx~ -- a spatial index of the features
           ~ {content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~shp~ ^* -- shape format; the feature geometry itself 
           ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

- ~shx~ ^* -- shape index format; a positional index of the feature
  geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly
  ~{content-type: x-gis/x-shapefile}~

Note: Files marked with ^* are mandatory.
